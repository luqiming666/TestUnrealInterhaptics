# TestUnrealInterhaptics
My initial UE project is designed to evaluate the interhaptics SDK. 
<br>
It is built upon the UE4 FPS sample project (with blueprint). I made adjustments to the FirstPersonCharacter blueprint and incorporated additional nodes to facilitate vibration upon receiving the 'Fire' input event.
<br>
*Testing Instructions*
<br>
Before launching the project on Windows, ensure that an Xbox controller is connected to the PC.
